	<p>MUMBAI: Adani Group stocks have been falling relentlessly since the damning report by Hindenburg was published on January 24. Over Rs 12 lakh crore in terms of market capitalisation of the Adani scrips has been wiped out, but not all group stocks have fallen in sync. This is where the valuation of individual stocks comes into play. The deep plunge has been possible due to sky-high valuations.
	<p>The Adani Total Gas stock has crashed nearly 81% since January 24, while Adani Ports has dived 27% in the same period â€” the fall is in sync with how overvalued they were. Adani Total Gas stock was trading at a multiple of 844 times its earnings on January 24, a number that not even the best disruptive technology company can boast of, while Adani Ports was at 30 times, according to price-to-earnings (PE) ratios sourced from Refinitiv database. Stocks that had relatively lower valuations have fallen less. ACC, which had a PE ratio of 54, has fallen the least (26%) among the 10 Adani Group stocks, followed by Adani Ports (27%) and Ambuja Cements (31%)</p>
