<h1>India vs Australia: Indore next pit stop in home dominance</h1>
<p>The surface is being preened and polished for the big occasion, the third Test between India and Australia starting from Wednesday. There is a veritable army of ground staff fussing and fretting over their latest creation. The pitch, after all, is a vital cog in Indiaâ€™s Test machinations at home

</p>
<p>The spin trio of Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Ravichandran Ashwin have showcased their all-round brilliance in the first two Tests and will once again be the major threats to the depleted visiting side, who will have a new captain in Indore. While Ashiwn and Jadeja have shown their ability with both bat and ball, Axar has delivered with the bat in both Tests, playing an important role in the first innings of India. Axar and Ashwin dug the hosts out from 139/7 to frustrate the Australians. Jadeja, who claimed three wickets in the first innings, completed the Test in Delhi with a 10 wickets following another five-wicket haul. The all-rounder, who made his return to international cricket in the series opener, has so far claimed 17 wickets in 2 Tests. Now, the action shifts to Holkar Cricket Stadium in Indore, which happens to be a replacement venue after the original third Test venue - Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) in Dharmashala - was deemed unfit to host the match due to harsh winter conditions.
